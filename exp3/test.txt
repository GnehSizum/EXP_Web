Have you ever paid close attention to a cloud and noticed its ever-changing forms? If not, you could be missing out on something quite wondrous.
Cloud spotting doesn't require much. Sometimes, it can be an invitation to be marveled by something so common that we've become blind to it. Or you can go deeper, trying to make sense of the sky by learning the different cloud types.
A pop science blogger surnamed Zheng, 25, known as the "Cloud Collector" on the lifestyle platform Xiaohongshu, initially started her account to share cloud photos in 2022.
Zheng, who enjoys finding delight in recording the beauty of daily life, considered it a way to spread lovely moments to more people."Clouds have always served as a source of comfort for me," said Zheng based in Fujian.
For Zheng, one of her most unforgettable cloud-spotting experiences occurred during a flight. It was the first time that she saw a special natural phenomenon called a "glory", produced by water drops in the air. It appeared as a hazy light point in the middle of a circular rainbow halo. "It was such a surprise," Zheng recalled.
As a growing number of online users began to show interest and raise questions, Zheng realized that she could offer more science content about cloud spotting. So she started to learn more by referring to specialized books and consulting individuals with expertise in meteorology.
Zheng has now shared nearly 200 pieces of popular science content, including cloud identification, formation, comparisons of different cloud types and weather-related knowledge. Her account now has over 210,000 followers on Xiaohongshu, and there are five group chats on the platform where thousands of users share their daily cloud-watching experiences.
Looking ahead, Zheng has plans to hold several gallery exhibitions. "The first round of exhibitions will be in Xiamen in Fujian and Chengdu in Sichuan," Zheng said, adding that she's gathering more cloud photos and the unique stories behind them.By doing this, she hopes to inspire more people to appreciate the beauty of the "gentle white giants" in the sky.
